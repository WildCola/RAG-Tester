The reimbursement of these expenses for moving movable property, including insurance costs to cover simple risks (break, theft, fire), shall be made within a ceiling which takes into account the family situation of the staff member at the time of the move, the distance between the place of recruitment and the place of employment and insurance costs.

From where, and to where, must the move take place?,,Upon entry into service, the removal must take place from the place of recruitment to the place of employment. On transfer, from the former place of employment to the new place of employment. Upon termination of service, the removal must take place from the last place of employment to the place of origin. If this place of origin does not coincide, it is necessary to request, in advance, a revision of the place of origin on the basis of patrimonial ties (property title or long-term lease agreement).

You can notify the end of your child's studies by sending an email to your file manager so that he or she can stop the payment as soon as possible (to prevent recovery of an amount overpaid).
How does my place of origin affect my individual entitlements?,,The concept of ‘place of origin’ is used to establish certain financial entitlements for officials and temporary or contract staff (annual travel expenses, travelling time and travel and removal expenses on termination of service).
How is the reference period calculated in order to establish my entitlement?,,The reference period expires six months before you take up your duties, and must equate to five years. Example: A staff member takes up his or her duties on 1 January 2014  minus six months = 1 July 2013 minus five years = 1 July 2008 We check where the staff member worked and resided throughout this period (1 July 2008 to 30 June 2013).

I am being transferred from another institution. Where will my place of origin be?,,If you are transferred from one EU institution to another (without a break), you keep the place of origin determined by the previous institution.
I am divorced and my former spouse has custody of our child(ren). What happens in this case?,,From the first day of the month following the divorce, the allowance – where it is granted by virtue of the dependent child(ren) – will be paid to the person having custody of the child(ren), in the name and on behalf of the staff member. NB: The allowance may be divided between the parents/designated guardians on the basis of the court decision on the divorce settlement (in the case of 50/50 shared or alternate custody, for example). If both the former spouses are employed by the EU and have alternating custody of the child(ren), each parent receives 50% of the household allowance, which is calculated based on the salary of the parent with the highest grade.
I am eligible for the household allowance. Does that mean I am automatically entitled to it?,,Yes, entitlement is automatic if you have a dependent child within the meaning of the Staff Regulations provided that the other parent is not entitled to (payment of) the allowance or if your spouse/stable partner is not gainfully employed (housewife/househusband or retired). In the case of staff members who do not have children and are married to, and/or recognised by Parliament as being in a stable partnership with, a person in gainful employment, entitlement to (and payment of) the allowance depends on their spouse/partner’s income from that employment  the Administration requests a copy of the spouse/partner’s salary slip and/or annual tax declaration in order to determine whether or not the staff member is entitled to the household allowance. This is examined annually based on the preceding year's review. Therefore, the allowance given in this case is provisional and may be subsequently withdrawn retroactively if revenues exceed the amounts specified.
I am financially responsible for my relatives. Am I entitled to an allowance of any kind?,,You may be entitled to an allowance equivalent to the dependent child allowance for anybody towards whom you have a legal obligation duly established by a competent judicial or administrative authority in the country of residence of the person to be treated.
I am getting divorced and my children will live mainly with their other parent. Will I be entitled to allowances for them?,,No, because the children live with their other parent, it will be the latter who actually receives the dependent child and education allowances. If the other parent is employed by an EU institution he or she will perceive the allowance directly from the institution. In other cases the EP pays the allowance directly into the bank account of the other parent (payment to a third party). You must therefore provide the bank details of the other parent, who in turn must inform us of the child's education, and the amount of benefits received elsewhere.
I am nearing retirement. Can I change my place of origin?,,From the age of 55, an official or other member of staff may ask to have his/her place of origin changed in preparation for retirement, upon production of supporting documents relating to ownership of property in the form of buildings, either existing or under construction. On final termination of the service of an official or other member of staff and with reference to his/her place of resettlement, his/her place of origin may be changed at his/her request by special decision of the Appointing Authority upon production of supporting documents (either the title deed for a building or a lease and recent bills). After termination of service for family or medical reasons, officials or agents who were recruited before 1 May 2004 and who had not received a pension on 1 May 2004 may request the appointing authority to change their place of origin. This decision is taken upon production of appropriate supporting documents by the official or staff member concerned.
I am registered as being in a stable non-marital partnership and my partner is unemployed, but I have not been granted the household allowance. Why not?,,This rule applies only to partnerships that do not meet the conditions for marriage laid down by the legislation of the Member State in which the couple resides  it consequently covers homosexual couples living in countries that prohibit homosexual marriages. Therefore, a heterosexual or homosexual partnership where the couple can be married but have chosen not to for personal reasons does not fulfil the conditions for receiving the household allowance. If you are registered as a stable non-marital partner in a country that does not allow marriage for same-sex couples and you move to a country where marriage is possible you will lose the right to the household allowance if you do not marry.
I have a child. What am I entitled to?,,If the child is less than 2 years' old, you are not entitled to annual travel expenses for that child. For children aged two or more annual travel costs are calculated on the same basis as for the official or agent  for this calculation, these children are said to be regarded as having completed their second year on 1 January of the year under way.
I have been asked to provide certified copies of documents. What does that mean? How do I do that?,,The documents required for determining your individual rights must be either originals or certified copies of the originals. Check out the list of authorities that are entitled to make certified copies.
I have remarried and my spouse has children. Am I entitled to allowances for these children, and on what conditions?,,Yes, if you can prove that the child of your spouse is actually your responsibility. You will have to provide the administration with birth certificates and a statement of household composition. The administration will also require the divorce act between your spouse and ex-spouse, detailing which parent has custody of the child. Proof of actual maintenance must be provided by you to the institution. A child is actually being maintained by you if he/she lives under your roof permanently or if you support the bulk of the child's needs: food, housing, medical expenses and other current expenses. If the child is considered your dependent you must inform us of allowances received elsewhere for the child, e.g. by the other parent of the child. If the child is between 18 and 26 years old, he or she must follow a school or university education, and submit registration documentation.
If I acquired the nationality of the country in which I am employed by marriage, do I qualify for the expatriation allowance?,,Staff members who have automatically acquired the nationality in question by marriage and cannot renounce it are treated in the same way as those who are not and never have been nationals of that state. On the other hand, staff members who have acquired the nationality in question without being under any obligation to do so are deemed to be nationals of that state, even if they retain their original nationality (dual nationality). In this case the conditions for granting the allowance are the same as those applicable to staff who had the nationality of the place of employment at the time they were hired.
If my place of employment changes, am I still entitled to the expatriation allowance?,,Your file is reviewed whenever your place of employment changes, which may give rise to the withdrawal or granting of the expatriation or foreign residence allowance.
If there is any change in my entitlement to the expatriation or foreign residence allowance as a result of my acquiring the nationality of the country in which my place of employment is situated, when will it take effect?,,If you cease to be entitled to the allowance as a result of acquiring the nationality of the country in which your place of employment is situated, the Administration will stop paying it after the last day of the month in which you acquired that nationality.
In what situations will it be possible to make a transfer?,,The following may be transferred, separately or in combination: dependent child payments for all children attending an education establishment in another Member State. The maximum amount per dependent child is equal to the amount of the flat-rate education allowance actually received for that child  on production of valid supporting documents, regular payments to all other persons residing in the relevant Member State to whom the official provides evidence of having an obligation by virtue of a decision of the courts or the competent administrative authority. These transfers may not exceed 5% of the official's basic salary. The amounts transferred are subject to the weighting of the country to which the transfer is made. An official may request a regular transfer to another bank account opened in his name in another Member State at the monthly exchange rate, without application of any weighting. This transfer may not exceed 25% of the official's basic salary.
Is the fact that a staff member has worked for an international organisation taken into account in these calculations?,,The period during which the staff member worked for an international organisation is neutralised, meaning that it cannot be taken into account  the five-year period expiring six months before the staff member took up his or her duties will therefore be extended by the number of years he or she worked for the international organisation.
My child (aged between 18 and 26) lives at home, but is not in any kind of training and does not have a job. Will I receive the dependent child allowance?,,No. However, you may apply for a six-month tax rebate on presentation of a jobseeker’s certificate and a statement of the composition of the household, which can be renewed once.
My child attends a childcare centre. Do I need to complete the application form for an education allowance?,,No, not until your child starts primary school. The pre-school education allowance is paid automatically on presentation of the child’s birth certificate.
My child attends a primary/secondary school and I will have to pay for his/her accommodation outside the family home. Am I entitled to reimbursement of these expenses?,,Yes, up to a maximum amount of EUR 320.12 per month. When you submit the application form for the education allowance, do not forget to ask the accommodation provider to complete Annex II.
My child had taken a break from studying but plans to start again this year. Will I be entitled to the education allowance again?,,Yes, until your child turns 26. Secondary school attendance must be regular (for at least three months) and full-time (at least 16 hours of classes per week). In the case of higher education, there are no minimum requirements as regards hours of study provided that your child is following full-time studies which entitle the student to receive an official diploma recognised by the Member State where the university is located.
My child is continuing to study beyond the age of 26. Am I entitled to any benefits?,,Yes, you can submit a tax rebate application which can be renewed up to the age of 30 on the basis of supporting documents (tax rebate application and certificate of enrolment at a higher education establishment). To qualify, your child must continue the same studies commenced before his 26th birthday.
My child is enrolled at university. Can you tell me: what to do? which documents I need to submit? the amount of the flat-rate allowance?,,You must declare your child's education via HRM Portal. Concerning the documents to be provided: Annex I, duly completed and signed or a university enrolment certificate. If your child is eligible for a scholarship you must also send the decision from the agency paying the scholarship indicating the amount granted. The flat-rate allowance depends on the country in which the higher education establishment is located and its distance from your place of employment. If your child is studying in the country in which you are employed, you are entitled to the standard amount of EUR 320.12 per month. If your child is attending an establishment at least 50 km from your place of employment and in a different country, the allowance will be doubled to EUR 640.24 per month provided that you do not have the nationality or language of your place of employment.
My child receives a grant. Should I declare it?,,All types of grants must be declared so that the amount can be deducted from the school fees paid by the institution (Article 68 of the Rules). The fact that it is paid directly to the child does not mean that it is exempt (Court Judgment 117/89).
My child starts primary school this year. Do I need to notify you?,,Yes, your file needs to be updated and the corresponding family allowances adjusted. Your entitlement to the pre-school allowance ceases on the first day of the month your child starts primary school. Please note that you have to submit the declaration of schooling for your child via HRM Portal or by sending an application form for an education allowance to the administration every year for the duration of your child’s schooling.
My children still attend the same school. Why do I have to complete the application for an education allowance every year?,,ou have to confirm and/or update your children’s schooling details so that your entitlement to the education and dependent child allowances can be verified. In addition, these details must be updated at the start of every academic year so that our staff can reimburse school enrolment fees and/or transport costs and in particular for reimbursement of transportation expenses for the transport associations of the European Schools.
My contract is for less than nine months. Am I entitled to travel expenses?,,No.
My family situation changed in the course of the year. What consequences could this have?,,Any alteration to the basis of calculation arising from changes in your family situation which occurs after the date of payment of the sums in question does not make you liable to repay those sums.
My spouse receives a national allowance. Should I declare it?,,You should declare the amount of national allowances received so that they can be deducted from those paid by the institution (Article 69 of the Rules). National family allowances have priority over the allowances of the European Union (Court Judgment 186/85).
My spouse receives allowances from other sources. Do we have to forgo them?,,No. Those allowances take priority over the allowances paid by Parliament, from which they will, however, be deducted.
My spouse works for another European institution and is paid a salary higher than mine. Which of us will receive the dependent child allowance?,,Family allowances are paid to the staff member with the higher salary.
My spouse/recognised partner is also entitled to a similar allowance: what do I have to do?,,You are obliged to declare any allowances received by your spouse/partner. If the allowance is deemed to be of like nature, it will be deducted from the one paid by Parliament in accordance with the rule prohibiting aggregation. One example is the family benefits paid by government departments in Luxembourg and in Belgium. If the allowance is deemed to be of a different nature, it will not have any financial impact on the staff member’s allowance. One example is the household allowance paid to employees of private-sector firms, such as banks and insurance companies, in Luxembourg.
On what basis does the Appointing Authority determine my place of origin?,,Upon entry into service, the place of origin is presumed to be the place of recruitment. However, at your request, submitted within one year of this entry to service  and on the basis of necessary supporting documents, your place of origin may be established at your centre of interests if the latter doesn’t coincide with your place of recruitment. You centre of interests is determined on the basis of your family ties, your patrimonial ties and your civic interests.
Parliament has granted me the household allowance. How much will I receive?,,The household allowance is made up of a fixed sum (EUR 215.91) plus 2% of your basic salary (as of 1 July 2023, subject to annual adjustment).
I have been an official since 1 January 2000, am a Spanish national currently employed at the EP in Luxembourg, and receive the expatriation allowance. I lived in Luxembourg for a period during the 1990s, when I worked for an insurance company. If I acquired Luxembourgish nationality (while also retaining my Spanish nationality), would I cease to be entitled to the expatriation allowance? Would it make any difference if I renounced my original nationality?,,Yes, you would cease to be entitled to the expatriation allowance because you would no longer fulfil the requirements set out in Article 4(1) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, given that you would possess the nationality of the country in which your place of employment is situated and did not habitually reside outside the territory of Luxembourg throughout the 10 years prior to the date you entered the service. It would not make any difference whether you renounced your Spanish nationality.
I have been an official since 1 January 2002  I am an Italian national, but have always lived in Belgium. I am currently employed at the EP in Brussels and receive the foreign residence allowance. If I acquired Belgian nationality without renouncing my Italian nationality, would I continue to be entitled to this allowance?,,Because you habitually resided in Belgium prior to entering the service, you would cease to be entitled to the foreign residence allowance as soon as you became a Belgian citizen, irrespective of whether you renounced or kept your Italian nationality.
I am German, and became an official on 1 January 2003 when I took up a post at the EP in Brussels, which I still hold. Prior to this I had always lived in Berlin, and I am entitled to the expatriation allowance. If I opted to become Belgian, would I still be entitled to it?,,Yes, you would still be entitled to the expatriation allowance even if you became a Belgian citizen. You would no longer fulfil the requirements set out in Article 4(1)(a) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, but you would be entitled to the allowance under Article 4(1)(b) of that Annex.
